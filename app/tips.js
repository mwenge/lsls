`# Here's a tip:
#  io10.dev will automatically detect the language you're using, most of the time.
#  For short one-liners, you can force language detection by using a 'shebang' on the
#  first line of the script, e.g.:
#
#    #!/bin/python
#    x = 9
#    print(x)
#
#  The available shebangs are:
#
#    #!/bin/python
#    #!/bin/py
#    #!/bin/js
#    #!/bin/sql
#    #!/bin/r
#    #!/bin/lua
#    #!/bin/awk
